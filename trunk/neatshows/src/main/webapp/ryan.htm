<p>Here's the two versions of those songs.&nbsp; Conrad and I like the short 
fade version, but Reba likes the long fade version.&nbsp; The actual cdr should 
be to you in a day or two.</p>

<p><b>The Wedding Song </b></p>
<p>by Tales From The Birdbath</p>
<p><b>(c</b> &amp; <b>p</b> 2004 Chirp Chirp Chirp Music)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the groom fixes his bow tie, the bride fixes her hair</p>
<p>and all the ex-boyfriends pretend that they don't care</p>
<p>the parents are getting nervous as the time it comes to go</p>
<p>the lights go down and the curtain's up on a one night only show</p>
<p>and it's time, yes it's time for the wedding song</p>
<p>2 laptop computers and 2 vespa scooters</p>
<p>2 record collections with 2 garage rock sections</p>
<p>the maid of honor is a half hour late and the best man is half drunk</p>
<p>and the get away car is ready to go with the keys locked in the trunk</p>
<p>all the grandparents and groomsmen and waiters all agree</p>
<p>that everything wrong is right again with you standing next to me</p>
<p>and it's time, yes it's time for the wedding song</p>
<p>2 sets of scooter keys and 2 too tight baby tees</p>
<p>2 pairs of chuck taylors and 2 bottles of makers</p>
<p>2 stops on christmas day with 2 big credit card bills to pay</p>
<p>2 pairs of sunglasses just like jackie o'nassis</p>
<p>2 kisses on the way</p>
<p>2 times I do we'll say</p>
<p>2 rings you're stuck with me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
